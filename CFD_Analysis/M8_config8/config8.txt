Air
Freestream velocity = 40 m/s 
Reynold number = ?

boundary conditions:
1. No Slip
- upper and lower wall of airfoil 
- Set “Near-wall treatment” to ‘Wall
Resolved’ 
- “Roughness height” to 0 
- Set “Wall velocity type” to ‘Zero’

2. “Far Field”
- upper
and lower
surfaces of the
circular rim
- “X velocity” as 40 m/s

3. “Slip”
- +/- Z normal surfaces

mesh details:
1. “Edge”
- two edge curves of
the airfoil on the +Z normal
face
- Average element size c/256

2. “Edge Layer”
- two edge curves of the
airfoil on the +Z normal face
- First layer thickness to c/15,000
- Total number of layers to 30 
- Growth method to Constant 
- Growth rate to 1.2
- Termination policy to ‘Truncate’
- Enable surface mesh modification

Zones:
Rectangular zone:
length x = 2.2c = 2.2*0.6096 = 1.34112
length y = 0.3c = 0.3*0.6096 = 0.18288
length z = 0.3c = 0.3*0.6096 = 0.18288
Average element size c/256

Surface Mesh:
Average element size: c/256

Extrusion:
Element size along extrusion = c/5 = 0.6096/5 = 0.12192

3. "Volume”
- Mesh size to ‘Maximum Size’
- Maximum element size to c = 0.6096
